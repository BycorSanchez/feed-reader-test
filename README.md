# Feed reader testing project

This is the sixth required project on the [Udacity Front End Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

The aim on this project is to test our application, *feed reader*, by using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/), an intuitive JavaScript testing library.

## How to run

### Locally

1. [Clone](https://github.com/BycorSanchez/feed-reader-test) or download [â¬‡](https://github.com/BycorSanchez/feed-reader-test/archive/master.zip) the project
2. Open *`index.html`* file on your preferred browser

### Online

Alternatively, it is also available online at [https://bycorsanchez.github.io/feed-reader-test/](https://bycorsanchez.github.io/feed-reader-test/).

## Content

Jasmine tests are displayed at the bottom of the *feed reader* application, so you might need to scroll down to see them.

* Tests running correctly are displayed in **green**.
* Test with any error are displayed in **red** and display an error message.
